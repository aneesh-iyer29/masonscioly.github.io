          <p>Science Olympiad is a nation-wide competition that features 23
            different science-related events. Our coach always compares it to a
            "track team for SCIENCE." Teams of 15 students compete in pairs or
            groups of 3 in the various events. They can range from building and 
            engineering to study and lab, covering topics from physics and chemistry to
            biology and mechanical engineering.</p>
          <p>Science Olympiad is a program that promotes strong team bonds,
            leadership, and above all else, fosters a passion for STEM.</p>

          <p>At Mason, we compete in Division C at the high school. Our club was established 
            in 2003 - since then, we've competed against national-level teams from all around the country, from California
            to Texas to here in Ohio.</p>
          
          <p>We're one of the most popular, engaging, and rigorous competitive
            academic clubs at our school. Out of 60 other teams in the state, we have consistently
            ranked within the top 4 for 6 years. In addition, we
            have dominated all other teams within the Southwest Cincinnati
            region, allowing us to have attended the State Tournament in our
            division at The Ohio State University for the past 20 years. 
            We were crowned State Champions at the Ohio State Tournament held on April 28th, 2018, winning the National-Runner-Up title
	    the first time we attended Nationals at Colorado State University on May 19, 2018.
		In the 2018-2019 season, we qualified for Nationals at Cornell and succeeded in placing 
		4th overall with 7 placings total. Unfortunately, due to the Coronavirus Pandemic, the 
		State and National Tournaments scheduled for 2020 were cancelled. Soon after, we were crowned Science 
		Olympiad National Champions, having won the National Tournament in both 2021 and 2022. 
		At the 2023 National Tournament, we finished in 3rd place, and at the 2024 National Tournament, we finished in 7th.
	  	In 2025, we reclaimed the 1st place trophy at the 2025 State Tournament, 
		and went on to achieve 3rd at Nationals once again! </p>
